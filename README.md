# Star-Ocean-2
An attempt to create an English patch for Star Ocean Second Evolution (Vita).

## Hacker Note 1
> Note for anyone trying to patch ENG text. Entire game is one `psarc` file. It's easily extracted and reencrypted. Structure appears same as PSP ver, so, I think it is possibly easy to patch official PSP ENG translation.
